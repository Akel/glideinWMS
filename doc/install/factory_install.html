                    A major installation, serving tens of sites and several thousand glideins will require 
                    <b>several CPUs</b> (recommended <b>4-8</b>: 1 for the Condor damons, 1-2 for the glidein
                    factory daemons and 2 or more for Condor-G schedds) and a reasonable amount of

                    disk caching).

                <p>
                    The <b>disk</b> needed is for binaries, config files, log files and Web monitoring data 
                    (For just a few sites, <b>10GB</b> could be enough, larger installations will need 
                    <b>100+GB</b> to maintain a reasonable history).  Monitoring can be pretty I/O intensive 
                    when serving many sites, so get the fastest disk you can afford, or consider setting up a 
                    RAMDISK.

    <h3><a name="software_httpd">3.2 HTTP Server</a></h3>
    <p>
        The glidein Factory needs a HTTP server, like <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> or 
        <a href="http://www.stllinux.org/meeting_notes/2001/0719/tux/intro.html">TUX</a>.  The server should be installed on 
        the same node, but a different node can be used as long as the web area is writable from this one. Servers often come 
        pre-installed with HTTP server software, so if you have one running, just reuse it.  Otherwise, the installer can help 
        you install one (as root).  (See <a href="glidein_component_install.html#system_httpd">GlideinWMS Component Install</a>) 
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="software_rrdtool">3.3 RRDTool</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will also need the python module for <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> (v1.2.18 or later). Many 
        systems come with packages for it; if possible use that.  Otherwise see 
        <a href="glidein_component_install.html#system_rrdtool">additional install notes</a> for alternative installs.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="software_m2crypto">3.4 M2Crypto</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will need the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/m2crypto">M2Crypto python library</a>. A few systems include it in the 
        software distribution; if possible install the system one.  Otherwise see 
        <a href="glidein_component_install.html#system_m2crypto">additional install notes</a> for alternative installs.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="software_javascriptRRD">3.5 javascriptRRD</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will need the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javascriptrrd/">javascriptRRD package</a>.  It contains the 
        javascript libraries needed by the monitoring.  Just download the tarball (with flot), and untar it.  You will need to 
        point the installer to this directory.

    <h3><a name="before_install_certs">4.2 Required Certificates/Proxies</a></h3>
    <p>
        The installer will ask for several DNs for GSI authentication.  You have the option of using a service certificate or a proxy.  These should be
        created and put in place before running the installer.  The following is a list of DNs the installer will ask for:
        <ul>
            <li>WMS Collector cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>VO Frontend proxy DN (cannot use a cert here)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Note:</strong> In some places the installer will also ask for nicknames to go with the DNs.  For the most part the name given doesn't 
        really matter.  There is one case where is does matter.  If you are using privilege separation, then, on the WMS Collector, the nickname for 
        each VO Frontend must be the username that you created for the frontend. <br>
        <strong>Note 2:</strong> The installer will ask if these are trusted Condor Daemons.  Answer 'y'. 
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="before_install_dirs">4.3 Required Directories</a></h3>
    <p>
        When installing the Factory you will be presented with a question asking for the directory location for various items.  The example below puts
        many of them in /var.  All the directories in /var have to be created as root.  Therefore, if you intend on using /var, you will have to create 
        the directories ahead of time.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The web data must be stored in a directory served by the HTTP Server. <br><br>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre>
Where will you host your config files?: [/var/gfactory/glideinsubmit] /home/gfactory/glideinsubmit
Where will you host your log files?: [/var/gfactory/glideinlogs] /var/gfactory/glideinlogs
Where will you host the client log files?: [/var/gfactory/clientlogs] /var/gfactory/clientlogs
Where will you host the client proxies files?: [/var/gfactory/clientproxies]/var/gfactory/clientproxies
Where will the web data be hosted?: [/var/www/html/glidefactory] /var/www/html/glidefactory
</pre>

    <h3><a name="before_install_misc">4.4 Miscellaneous Notes</a></h3>
    <p>
        At some point the installer will prompt you for the OSG VDT Client location or if you want to install it.  The installer will install the client
        for you.  (See <a href="glidein_component_install.html">GlideinWMS Component Install</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        When asked if you want OSG_VDT_BASE defined globally? Answer 'y' unless you want to force your users to find and hard code the location.
    </p>
    <p>When asked if you want to enable Match authentication, if you are using Condor 7.1.3 or later, answer 'y' unless you have a reason not to.</p>

    <h2><a name="condor">5. glideinWMS Collector installation guide</a></h2>

    <p>
        If you are installing privilage separation, you need to install glideinWMS Schedds and Collector as root.  Otherwise, they can be installed 
        as a non-privileged user.  If installing as a non-priveleged user, it is recommended that both the WMS Collector and the Factory share the 
        same credentials.  In either case, the Collector needs access to <a href="gsi_config.html">GSI credentials</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>Move into</p>

    <blockquote>glideinWMS/install</blockquote>

    <p>and execute</p>

    <blockquote>./glideinWMS_install</blockquote>

    <p>
        You will be presented with the service selection screen. Follow the instructions and install all the software components. 
        Most of the questions should be fairly straightforward. The part that is not completely automatic is the configuration of 
        the GSI security; you will need to provide the DN of the glidein factory (if different from the collector one) and the DN
        of the VO frontend.
    </p>
    <p>If you are installing privilage separation, you need to install glideinWMS Schedds and Collector as root</p>
    <p>Here a possible set of answers is presented; your setup will probably be slightly different:</p>

Installing condor

Which user should Condor run under?: [condor] <b>gfactory</b>

You will now need the Condor tarball
You can find it on http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/
Versions v7.2.2 and 7.3.1 have been tested, but you
should always use the latest one

Where do you have the Condor tarball? <b>/home/gfactory/downloads/condor-7.4.2-linux-x86_64-rhel5-dynamic.tar.gz</b>
Checking...
Seems condor version 7.4.2

Where do you want to install it?: [/opt/glidecondor] /home/gfactory/glidecondor
Directory '/home/gfactory/glidecondor' does not exist, should I create it?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Installing condor in '/home/gfactory/glidecondor'

If something goes wrong with Condor, who should get email about it?: <b>admin@my.org</b>
Extracting from tarball
Running condor_configure
Installing Condor from /home/gfactory/glidecondor/tar/condor-7.4.2 to /home/gfactory/glidecondor

Condor has been installed into:
    /home/gfactory/glidecondor

Configured condor using these configuration files:
  global: /home/gfactory/glidecondor/etc/condor_config
  local:  /home/gfactory/glidecondor/condor_local/condor_config.local
You should look inside the installation log for some details about how
Condor was installed.
Created scripts which can be sourced by users to setup their
Condor environment variables.  These are:
   sh: /home/gfactory/glidecondor/condor.sh
  csh: /home/gfactory/glidecondor/condor.csh

Do you want to split the config files between condor_config and condor_config.local?: (y/n) [y] <b>y</b>
Condor installed

Privilege separation is needed to securely support multiple frontends.
Do you want to install it?: (y/n) [y]<b>y</b>
A privsep config (/etc/condor/privsep_config) is already in place. Do you want to recreate it?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
What is the factory username: <b>gfactory</b>

List the usernames the factroy will use
to separate frontends from one another.
An empty username entry means you are done.
Username: <b>frontenduser1</b>
Username: <b>frontenduser2</b>

Directory '/var/gfactory/clientlogs' does not exist, should I create it?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Where will the factory store the client proxies?[/var/gfactory/clientproxies] <b>/var/gfactory/clientproxies</b>
Directory '/var/gfactory/clientproxies' does not exist, should I create it?: (y/n) <b>y</b>

Privilege separation setup completed

Configuring GSI security

GSI security relies on a list of trusted CAs
Where can I find the directory with the trusted CAs?

Do you want to get it from VDT?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Do you have already a VDT installation?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Where is the VDT installed?: <b>/home/gfactory/vdt</b>
Using VDT installation in <b>/home/gfactory/vdt</b>

To use the GSI security for WMS Collector, you either need
a valid GSI proxy or a valid x509 certificate and relative key.
Its subject (i.e. DN) will be added as the trusted daemon
in the condor configuration.

Will you be using a proxy or a cert? (proxy/cert) <b>proxy</b>
Where is your proxy located?: <b>/home/condor/security/grid_proxy.wmspool</b>
My DN = '/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Service/CN=gfactory/gfactory1.my.org'


You will most probably need other DNs in the condor grid mapfile.
The VO Frontend(s) will be contacting the WMS Collector
and will interact as daemons. Their subjects (i.e. DNs)
will most likely be needed.

Please insert all such DNs, together with a user nickname.
An empty DN entry means you are done.
DN: <b>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=frontend1.my.org</b>
nickname: [condor001] <b>vofrontend1</b>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
DN: <b>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=frontend2.my.org</b>
nickname: [condor002] <b>vofrontend2</b>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
DN:
What name would you like to use for this pool?: [My glideinWMS pool] <b>GlideinWMSPool</b>
What port should the collector be running?: [9618] <b>9618</b>
How many secondary schedds do you want?: [9] <b>9</b>
[...]
</pre>

    <p>The installer will also start the Condor daemons.  To stop the Condor daemons, issue</p>

    <blockquote>killall condor_master</blockquote>

    <p>To start them again:</p>

    <blockquote>cd &lt;install dir&gt;; ./start_condor.sh</blockquote>

        or having the VO Frontend serve up the proxy.  Standard configuration has the VO Frontend serving the proxy.  If the Factory will have its 
        own proxy, you need to create such proxy before instantiating a glidein Factory and then keep it valid for the life of the factory. If used 
        for job submission, this proxy must at any point in time have a validity of at least the longest expected job being run by the glideinWMS 
        (and not less than 12 hours).<br>
        How you keep this proxy valid (via MyProxy, kx509, voms-proxy-init from a local certificate, scp from other nodes, or other methods), 
        is beyond the scope of this document.
    </p>

    <p>
        The glidein factory itself should be installed as a non privileged user. The provided installer can be used to create the configuration
        file, although some manual tunning will probably be needed.
    </p>

    <p>Move into</p>

    <blockquote>glideinWMS/install</blockquote>

    <p>and execute</p>

    <blockquote>./glideinWMS_install</blockquote>

    <p>
      You will be presented with the service selection screen. Follow the instructions and install all the software components. Most of the 
      questions should be fairly straightforward. The part that is not completely automatic is the list of GCBs and the configuration of the 
      GSI security; you will need to provide the DNs of all the submit nodes. It is strongly recommended to use CCB over GCB if possible.
    </p>

    <p>Here a possible set of answers is presented; your setup will probably be slightly different:</p>

Installing Glidein Factory

Do you have already a javascriptRRD installation?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Where is javascriptRRD installed?: <b>/home/gfactory/javascriptrrd-0.5.0</b>
The Glidein Factory can be configured to use a default GSI proxy for submission.

However, this operation mode is not recommended.

Do you want to use such a proxy?: (y/n) [n] <b>n</b>

As you probably know, privilege separation
is needed to securely support multiple frontends.
If you are using privilege separation, the factory directories
must be world readable (except for the proxies dirs)

Hosting the config and log files in the factory home directory
is thus not recommended anymore.

Where will you host your config files?: [/var/gfactory/glideinsubmit] <b>/home/gfactory/glideinsubmit</b>
Where will you host your log files?: [/var/gfactory/glideinlogs] <b>/var/gfactory/glideinlogs</b>
Where will you host the client log files?: [/var/gfactory/clientlogs] <b>/var/gfactory/clientlogs</b>
Where will you host the client proxies files?: [/var/gfactory/clientproxies]<b>/var/gfactory/clientproxies</b>
Where will the web data be hosted?: [/var/www/html/glidefactory] <b>/var/www/html/glidefactory</b>
Directory '/var/www/html/glidefactory' not empty.
Should I use it anyhow?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
What Web URL will you use?: [http://gfactory1.my.org/glidefactory/] <b>http://gfactory1.my.org/glidefactory</b>
Give a name to this Glidein Factory?: [mySites-gfactory1] <b>GlideinFactory-gfactory1</b>
Give a name to this Glidein instance?: [v1_0] <b>v1_0</b>
What is the Condor base directory?: [/home/gfactory/glidecondor]<b>/home/gfactory/glidecondor</b>
The following glidein schedds have been found:
 [1] schedd_glideins1@gfactory1.my.org
 [2] schedd_glideins2@gfactory1.my.org

 [5] schedd_glideins7@gfactory1.my.org
 [5] schedd_glideins8@gfactory1.my.org
 [5] schedd_glideins9@gfactory1.my.org
Do you want to use all of them?: (y/n) <b>y</b>

Do you want to use gLExec?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Do you want to fetch entries from RESS?: (y/n) [n] <b>y</b>
Which RESS server should I use?: [osg-ress-1.fnal.gov] <b>osg-ress-1.fnal.gov</b>

Found 28 additional entries
Do you want to use them all?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Do you want to fetch entries from BDII?: (y/n) [n]<b>n</b>
Please list all additional glidein entry points,

Entry name (leave empty when finished):
Should glideins use the more efficient Match authentication (works for Condor v7.1.3 and later)?: (y/n) [y] <b>y</b>

For security reasons, we want to whitelist all the frontends that we will be serving.
Each frontend should be segregated to its own (set of) username(s).
If you do not want privilege separation, you can still just use the factory user.

Please list the frontends you will be serving:

Frontend security name (leave empty when finished): <b>vofrontend1</b>
Frontend identity (like vo1@gfactory1.my.org): <b>frontenduser1@gfactory1.my.org</b>
Frontend proxy security class: [frontend]
Username: <b>frontenduser1</b>

Frontend security name (leave empty when finished): <b>vofrontend2</b>
Frontend identity (like vo1@gfactory1.my.org): <b>frontenduser2@gfactory1.my.org</b>
Frontend proxy security class: [frontend]
Username: <b>frontenduser2</b>

Frontend security name (leave empty when finished):
Do you want to create the glidein (as opposed to just the config file)?: (y/n) [n]<b>n</b>
To create the glidein, you need to run
/home/gfactory/glideinWMS/creation/create_glidein /home/gfactory/glideinsubmit/glidein_v1_0.cfg/glideinWMS.xml

Configuration files are located in /home/gfactory/glideinsubmit/glidein_v1_0.cfg
</pre>

    <p>
        If you followed the example above, you ended up with a configuration file in
        <b>/home/gfactory/glideinsubmit/glidein_v1_0.cfg/glideinWMS.xml</b>. Edit this file to suit your needs and than create the factory 
        instance as described in the Manual configuration section below.
    </p>
    
    <p>At this point you can start the factory with</p>

    <blockquote><i>&lt;install dir&gt;/</i>factory_startup start</blockquote>

    <p>where the <i>&lt;install dir&gt;</i> is the one written out by the installation script.</p>

    <p>To stop the factory the factory, use</p>

    <blockquote><i>&lt;install dir&gt;</i>/factory_startup stop</blockquote>

    <h3><a name="factory_manual">6.1 Manual configuration</a></h3>

    <p>
        The glidein factory can also be configured manually.<br>
        The complete guide can be found in the <a href="../manual/factory/entry.html">glideinWMS documentation</a>, but in 
        <a href="example-config/glide-factory/config_v1.xml">example-config/glide-factory/config_v1.xml</a> you can find a working example.
    </p>

    <p>Once a configuration file is ready, you can create the glidein Factory by executing</p>

    <blockquote>cd glideinWMS/creation<br> ./create_glidein <i>&lt;config file&gt;</i></blockquote>

    <p>The startup procedure is the same as described above.</p>

    <h3><a name="factory_update">6.2 Changing the factory configuration</a></h3>

    <p>
        Occasionally, you may need to change the glidein Factory configuration.  This is done by updating the configuration file and 
        reconfiguring.<br>
        <b>Warning:</b> Never update the <i>&lt;install dir&gt;</i>/glideinWMS.xml file! Either use the configuration file you used to
        install it, or make a copy of the glideinWMS.xml file and modify that one.
    </p>

    <p>Once you are done editing the work config file, reconfigure the factory with</p>

    <blockquote><i>&lt;install dir&gt;/</i>factory_startup reconfig <i>&lt;work config&gt;</i></blockquote>

    <p>If the factory was running, the procedure will stop the factory before reconfiguring it, and restart it afterwards.</p>

    <h2><a name="monitoring">7. Glidein Factory monitoring</a></h2>

    <p>There are several ways to monitor the entry points of the glidein factory:</p>

    <h3><a name="monitoring_web">7.1 Glidein factory entry Web monitoring</a></h3>

    <p>
        You can either monitor the factory as a whole, or just a single entry point.<br>
        <br>
        The factory monitoring is located at a URL like the one below
    </p>

    <blockquote>http://gfactory1.my.org/glidefactory/monitor/glidein_v1_0/</blockquote>

    <p>
        Moreover, each entry point, has its own history on the Web.<br>
        <br>
        Assuming you have a SanDiego entry, it can be monitored at

    <p>You can get the equivalent of the Web page snaphot by using</p>

    <blockquote>cd glideinWMS/tools/<br>python wmsXMLView.py</blockquote>

    <h3><a name="monitoring_logs">7.3 Glidein factory entry log files</a></h3>

    <p>
        The glidein factory writes two log files per entry point <b>factory_info.YYYYMMDD.log</b> 
        and <b>factory_err.YYYYMMDD.log</b>.<br>
        <br>
        Assuming you have a SanDiego entry, the log files are in
    </p>

    <blockquote>/home/gfactory/glidein_submit/glidein_v1_0/entry_SanDiego/log</blockquote>

    <p>
        All errors are reported in the <b>factory_err.YYYYMMDD.log</b>. file, while <b>factory_info.YYYYMMDD.log</b>
        contains entries about what the factory is doing.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="monitoring_glideins">7.4 Glidein output</a></h3>

    <p>
        Each glidein creates 2 files on exit; job.<b>ID</b>.out and job.<b>ID</b>.err.<br>

        Assuming you have a SanDiego entries, the log files are in
    </p>

    <blockquote>/home/gfactory/glidein_submit/glidein_v1_0/entry_SanDiego/log</blockquote>

    <p>Problems are usually reasonably easy to spot.</p>

    <h3><a name="monitoring_condor">7.5 Glidein factory ClassAds in the WMS Collector</a></h3>

    <p>
        The glidein factory also advertises summary information in the WMS collector.<br>
        <br>
        Use <b>condor_status</b>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>condor_status -any</blockquote>
