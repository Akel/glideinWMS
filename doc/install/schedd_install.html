            If you are using Condor version v7.3.2 disable VOMS checking in condor_config file used by Condor daemons other 
            than that used by user schedd. VOMS checking adds unrequired overhead. To do so, set <br>
            <blockquote>USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTES = False </blockquote> 
            or for individual condor daemons like collector<br>

    <h3><a name="before_install_certs">4.1 Required Certificates/Proxies</a></h3>
    <p>
        The installer will ask for several DNs for GSI authentication.  You have the option of using a service certificate or a proxy.  These should be
        created and put in place before running the installer.  The following is a list of DNs the installer will ask for:
        <ul>
            <li>Glidein Submitter cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>Pool Collector cert/proxy DN</li>
            <li>Glidein Factory cert/proxy DN</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Note:</strong> In some places the installer will also ask for nicknames to go with the DNs.  For the most part the name given doesn't 
        really matter.  There is one case where is does matter.  If you are using privilege separation, then, on the WMS Collector, the nickname for 
        each VO Frontend must be the username that you created for the frontend. 
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="before_install_misc">4.2 Miscellaneous Notes</a></h3>
    <p>When asked if you want to enable Match authentication, if you are using Condor 7.1.3 or later, answer 'y' unless you have a reason not to.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="condor">5. Installation instructions</a></h2>
    <p>
        The scheduler node software should be installed as root. While it is possible to run the schedds as a non-privileged user, it has some serious
        security implications; see the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.0/3_6Security.html#sec:Non-Root">Condor manual</A> for details.
        The whole process is managed by a install script described below.

Welcome to the glideinWMS Installation Helper

What do you want to install?
(May select several options at one, using a , separated list)
[1] glideinWMS Schedds and Collector
[2] Glidein Factory
[3] GCB
[4] User Pool Collector
[5] User Schedd
[6] Condor for VO Frontend
[7] VO Frontend
[8] Components

    <p>Select <b>5</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Now follow the instructions and install all the software components. Most of the questions should be fairly straightforward. The part 
        that is not completely automatic is the configuration of the GSI security; you will need to provide the DN of the pool collector and the
        DN of the glidein factory.

    <p>Here a possible set of answers is presented; your setup will probably be slightly different:</p>

Installing condor


You will now need the Condor tarball
You can find it on http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/
Versions v7.2.2 and 7.3.1 have been tested, but you
should always use the latest one

Where do you have the Condor tarball? <b>/root/condor-7.4.2-linux-x86_64-rhel5-dynamic.tar.gz</b>
Checking...
Seems condor version 7.4.2

Where do you want to install it?: [/opt/glidecondor] <b>/opt/glidecondor</b>
Directory '/opt/glidecondor' does not exist, should I create it?: (y/n) <b>y</b>
Installing condor in '/opt/glidecondor'

If something goes wrong with Condor, who should get email about it?: <b>admin@my.org</b>
Extracting from tarball
Running condor_configure
Installing Condor from /opt/glidecondor/tar/condor-7.4.2 to /opt/glidecondor

Condor has been installed into:
    /opt/glidecondor

Configured condor using these configuration files:
  global: /opt/glidecondor/etc/condor_config
  local:  /opt/glidecondor/condor_local/condor_config.local
You should look inside the installation log for some details about how
Condor was installed.
Created scripts which can be sourced by users to setup their
Condor environment variables.  These are:
   sh: /opt/glidecondor/condor.sh
  csh: /opt/glidecondor/condor.csh

Do you want to split the config files between condor_config and condor_config.local?: (y/n) [y] <b>y</b>

The Condor config has been put in your login files
Please remember to exit and reenter the terminal after the install

Condor installed

Configuring GSI security

To use the GSI security, you either need a valid GSI proxy or
a valid x509 certificate and relative key
The cert/proxy subject of User Schedd, Glidein Pool Collector and VO Frontend
(used by glidein startd) will be added as the trusted daemon in GSI_DAEMON_NAME 
in the condor configuration.
Will you be using a proxy or a cert? (proxy/cert) <B>cert</B>
Where is your certificate located?: <B>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</B>
Where is your certificate key located?: <B>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</B>
My DN = '/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=submit1.my.org'

Glidein Pool Collector and VO Frontend and glidein startd will connect to and
act as client to User Schedd. Subjects for these services should be in the 
gridmap file of the User Schedd.
Please insert all such DNs, together with a user nickname.
An empty DN entry means you are done.
DN: <B>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=collector1.my.org</B>
nickname: [condor001] <B>collector</B>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) y
DN: <B>/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Service/CN=gfactory/gfactory1.my.org</B>
nickname: [condor002] <B>pilot</B>
Is this a trusted Condor daemon?: (y/n) <B>y</B>
DN: <I>enter</I>
Do you want to Use Quill (works for 6.8.X only)?: (y/n) [n] <B>n</B>
What node is the collector running (i.e. CONDOR_HOST)?: <B>collector1.my.org</B>
Please list all the GCB servers you will be using
Leave an empty line when finished
GCB node:<I>enter</I>
How many secondary schedds do you want?: [9] <B>4</B>

    </pre>

    <p>The installer will also start the Condor daemons.</p>
    <p>The installer also created init.d scripts in:</p> 
    <blockquote>/etc/init.d/condor</blockquote>
        
    <p>Use it to stop and restart the schedd(s)</p>
    <p>
        NOTE: Since Schedd node is installed as root, condor installer will create condor.sh and condor.csh files in /etc/profile.d so that you 
        have correct environment setup. If this machine hosts another condor installation or you prefer not to have user PATH and CONDOR_CONFIG 
        point to this condor setup automatically, you need to manually move these files out from the /etc/profile.d 
    </p>
        
    <h2><a name="submit">6. Submitting user jobs</a></h2>
    <p>
        From the user point of view, this is just a regular Condor pool.<br><br>
        However, since the resources potentially come from all over the world, users need to create more complex <b>Requirements</b>, 
        in order to prevent the jobs from landing on sites that cannot run their jobs.<br><br>
        Users will need to know which attributes the glideins publish and use them accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>One useful attribute that all glideins publish is GLIDEIN_Site. If a user wants to restrict its job to a list of sites, he can do it by using:</p>
    <blockquote>
        +DESIRED_Sites = &quot;Site1,Site4,Site7,Site22&quot;<br>
        Requirements = stringListMember(GLIDEIN_Site,DESIRED_Sites)
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Some glideins may also need to properly identify the final user, using GSI authentication. A user should thus add the following line:</p>
    <blockquote>x509userproxy = <I>&lt;path to X509 proxy&gt;</I></blockquote>
    
    <p>to their Condor submission file.</p>

    <h2><a name="fine_tune">7. Fine Tunning for Large Scale Installations</a></h2>
    <h3>7.1 Increase the number of available file descriptors</H3>

    <p>
        Number of ports used by the condor_schedd process increases as the number of jobs running/queued in the schedd increase. The default number
        of file descriptors per process is 1024 on most systems. Increase this limit to ~16k or value higher than number of jobs that might be in 
        the queue at any given time. This is particularly required for large scale installations. 
        <br><br>
        In most cases for default installation, user schedd is configured to start as root and started through the script in /etc/xinet.d/condor This
        is a good place to set higher file descriptor limit for the schedd process.
