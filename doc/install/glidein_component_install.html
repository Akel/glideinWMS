        At times the installer will give you the option to install the OSG VDT client.  Below is an example of an intall for reference.  It can also
        be installed using the installer.  <br><br>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless you know of a need to use a different version, accept the default pacman version listed by the installer</li>
            <li>Allow the installer to auto-detect your platform unless you want to force a specific platform</li>
            <li>Use the default OSG location, unless you have good reason to change it</li>
            <li>
                Unless you want your users to have to find and define the OSG VDT Client location themselves, when asked, answer 'y'
                to defining OSG_VDT_BASE globally</li>

VDT client installation tends to be very picky about the platforms it installs under
Most of the time, one needs to pretent to be one of the tested platforms
The platforms known to work are: linux-rhel-4,SL-4,linux-rhel-5,SL-5
Which platform do you want to use (leave empty for autodetect): 

The VDT installation will start in a moment.
CA certificates are installed as part of this procedure; ignore the VDT warning message.
Please do not enable Condor, as we will install it separatelly.

Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.



========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.




The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.


The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2.9 has been installed.
VDT does not provide a default URL for CA fetching       
You need to provide one
The default OSG location is: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version
Where should I fetch the CAs from?: [http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version]<b>http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version</b>

    <h3><a name="system_rrdtool">3. RRDTool</a></h3>
    <p>
        You will also need the python module for <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> (v1.2.18 or later). Many 
        systems come with packages for it; if possible use that.
    </p>

    <p>
        RPMs for Redhat/Scientific Linux distributions can be found at 
        <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rrdtool/">http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rrdtool/</a>
    </p>

    <p>Install python-rrdtool*.rpm and related dependencies.</p>

    <p>
        If installing as root is not an option, you can build from the sources, as the <b>glidein factory</b>
        user, and put the python libraries into the PYTHON_PATH.<br>
        The source code can be downloaded from: <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/">http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Beware: The build process has several dependencies that make it complicated. Use this option only if you cannot install from RPMs 
        (or similar). 
    </p>

    <h3><a name="system_m2crypto">4. M2Crypto</a></h3>

    <p>
        You will need the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/m2crypto">M2Crypto python library</a>. A few systems include it in the 
        software distribution; if possible install the system one.
    </p>

    <p>
        If your system does not come with m2crypto package, or you do not can/want install it as root, compile it from source as 
        the <b>glidein factory</b> user.<br>  The source code can be downloaded from:  
        <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto#Downloads">http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto#Downloads</a>
    </p>

    <p>The build process is very easy:</p>

    <blockquote>
        python setup.py build<br>
        python setup.py install --root <i>&lt;base dir&gt;</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Finally add M2Crypto site-packages into the PYTHONPATH, possibly in the .profile, .bashrc and/or in the .cshrc.<br>
        The exact path is system specific. On a 32bit system with python 2.3.x it will look like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<i>&lt;base dir&gt;</i>/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/</blockquote>
    <br>

    <h3><a name="system_javascriptRRD">5. javascriptRRD</a></h3>

    <p>
        You will need the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javascriptrrd/">javascriptRRD package</a>.  It contains the 
        javascript libraries needed by the monitoring.  Just download the tarball (with flot), and untar it.  You will need to 
        point the installer to this directory.
    </p>
